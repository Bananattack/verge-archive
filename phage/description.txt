P.H.A.G.E. Rhapsody V. 5.0 

by Greg "GMW" Walpole

This version *still* steals battle mechanics from Final Fantasy, 
mini-games from Tales of Destiny, secrets from Lunar SSSC, and 
recycles jokes by Sharkey. Absolutely 100% Originality-Free!

But seriously, fixed a bunch of bugs, added a huge chunk of game,
a number of side-quests, new ghost games, and two *very* hard bosses.
Plus the Battle system got modified a little, so there are lots of
strange enemy attacks, and I threw in some extra critters in earlier
parts of the game! 

Not fully compatible with earlier versions! (If you start from a
save from an earlier version, you will not be able to use your Anger
Moves, and certain spells will not call the correct values from their
.dat files.) You probably want to start over just because I added some
stuff to the early parts of the game.
