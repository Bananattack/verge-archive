Deicide v1.2
------------
The second incarnation of Deicide is here, and it's a dandy. Considerable cosmetic 
changes have been made, like fixing up portions of the Coast City map, and changing
the obstructions that so many found frustrating in the Doekeep Forest. A new
startup menu was coded (with a little help), and some new music has been added as
well. The second demo isn't quite as long as the first demo was, but it's pretty
cool. And it keeps ya hanging on until I release the full game this summer. :)
And now, the credits.

There are a few things you can expect before I release the full game. I -may-
upload a patch with some manga cells I didn't get around to including in the
game, if they are finished within a certain amount of time, if not I will
save them for the full game. If there are any bugs or quirks like the obstruction
thing, please e-mail me and I'll fix that and put a patch up. 

*Help Wanted!* No, I'm not asking to form a team with anyone. This is a mostly
solo project. However, I would love to work with some talented people on a 
"favors for favors" basis. If you can provide me with good art or a kickin'
music file, I will do programming or plot work for you, two things I am
quite proficient at. Even if I can't spell worth a damn. Just e-mail me
at the address below.

Enjoy Deicide!
