Changelog from 12/24/97 to 1/9/97:
 - VCTextNum now actually works. :)
 - ChangeCHR now works *properly*. (on characters other than the 1st one, and
   loads the specframe data properly, too.)
 - Gave VergeC access (read-only) to character stat variables: ATK, DEF, HIT,
   DOD, MAG, MGR, REA, MBL, FER. All variables take a party.dat character index;
   So VCTextNum(1,1,ATK[1]); would print Darin's attack power in the upper-
   left corner of the screen.

*NOTE*: It did not take me this long to do those three items. I completed
        everything in this patch in the last 2 days. :) I have been doing
        research the last several weeks, as detailed on the web page.
