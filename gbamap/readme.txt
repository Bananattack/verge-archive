-= Hatchet's Lousy GBA Maped Beta v0.3 =-

Features:

- You can hold two tiles at once, one for each mouse button. To select a tile, click on the tile in the tileset you wish to use with the desired mouse button.
- Hold Ctrl while clicking on the map to grab the tile under the cursor.
- Press A to increment the tile number for the left mouse button, Z to decrement it.
- Added tile highlighting to the map and the tileset, should make it easier to see where you're clicking.
- If you hold right shift and click, the highlighter will turn red. If you select a group of tiles, then click again, you will copy them onto the "clipboard" (only an 8x8 section of it is shown at bottom left, but you can copy areas larger than that :) To help you in placing your newly  copied tiles, the highlighter turns blue, and is the same size as your copied area. Click to place your copied section. When you no longer need the copied area, press P to turn it off. (Press P again to turn it back on again :)
   *Note: Currently, you can only select tiles down and to the right of where you first clicked. Just be aware of that. However, you can also use this to your advantage, if you didn't click on the right spot the first time. Just click to the top or left of it and it will cancel the copy :)

- You can save/load maps now. Press F2 to save the map as a new filename,  F3 to save the map with its current filename (if it's a new map it will prompt you). F4 will load a map.


- Alt-X exits.

Todo:

- Tileset saving
- Tileset loading (specifiable filename)
- Making new, blank maps
- Add map layers
- Add map/tile scrolling
- Any other suggested features
