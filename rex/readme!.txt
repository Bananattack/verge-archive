The Story:
The campfire flickers and fades as Rex stares into it, thinking of the events that have transpired.  The mysterious note telling him to go to the old mining town.  He thinks of the people he left, and the possibility
that he could be captured.  He falls down and sleep, listening to the wolves and other animals walking in the forest.

Gameplay:
Rex's Tale is a fun sword smashing romp of an adventure.
The arrow keys move Rex up, down, left, and right respectively.
Press space to slash your sword. (I included keys.vc if you want to customize this, just change #define keyattack 57 in system.vc to the key you want, and recompile. :)
Press enter to get past textboxes.

Use your sword to slash at enemies.  Kill them to get meat for restoring your HP bar.

Additional notes:
Sound is disabled by default.  To enable it, edit your user.cfg in your Rex's Tale directory and change sound_device 3 to sound_device 0.  But be warned, this may crash VERGE randomnly.  If this does happen, do not worry, if you keep trying, it will let you go by.  We have no reason why this is happening.

Thank you for taking the time to play our game,
