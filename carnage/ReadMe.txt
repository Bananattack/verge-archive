Carnage: Killing Spree!!! 
Demo 1.1 by CLIPs


Thanks for downloading my demo!!!

Saturday March 6, Update
-----------------------------

== First and Foremost

While playing this game one may misinterpret the midgets running around in playgrounds as children there to kill. If you believe they are kids (even though I'm saying they're midgets  (midget sprites at that) ) then please DON'T kill them!!! If they die its YOUR fault not mine. Thank you.

== New stuff

I have fixed up both my battle systems so now they're less buggy. Despite this I stil feel this is my buggiest update because I'm just releasing what I have done because I might not work on this for a very long time. You know with V2 coming out (today supposevly).

-----------------------------

==Introduction

Well a few years ago I started reading Spidey comics just because of Carnage, Venom and the whole Symbiote story line. I stopped just as quickly as I started because the clone stuff was pissing me off (If you were following it you know what I mean). Well Its been a few years but I still thinlk Carnage was the man! (I always root for the bad guy >:) ) I would be working on my original demo Cyber Zone (I'm currently reworking the Plot and graphics) but I'm not gonna start programming on it until Verge2 (16bit) is out. So to keep me busy and game developing while I wait I took this project as a sort of fanfic/tribute about my favourite Spidey villain. I dug through my old comics and reread them (the funnest part) and started peicing together some sort of story. It isn't a masterpeice because I planned on making the game mostly action. And well this is the product. I hope you have fun playing it because I had alot of fun making it.


==BackGround story

Now Carnage's story began a long time back in Spidey history when Spider-Man was chosen to fight in the Secret Wars with many other of Marvel's super heroes. When he got back to Earth he brought back a black costume he had found to use as a replacement for his tattered ones (ya know the blue and red).  Well any ways the costume did a lot of cool stuff like turn into Civilian clothes, put it self away, and make its own webbing, all when Spidey commanded it to mentally. Well it turned out the costume was an alien symbiote feeding off of Parker. He got rid of it and it went and found a new host who felt as much hatred for Spider Man who rejected it, as the symbiote did. His name was Eddie Brock and he hated Spider Man because of a lot of little things that resulted in him losing his job and his wife etc, etc. Well the symbiote and Eddie bonded and became Venom. As Venom they kicked the shit out of Spider-Man. Well, to make a long story short Spider-Man forced the symbiote off Brock some how and sent Brock to jail. In jail Brock was cell mates with an unrepentant serial killer named Cletus Kasady. Well one day the alien symbiote found its way back to Eddie and broke him out of jail. But, on the break out the symbiote spawned another. It gave birth. Symbiotes reproduce asexually. And the young symbiote went and bonded with Cletus Kasady, creating Carnage! (The red dude on the left) 

Well Carnage escaped and killed lots of people. He met up with Spider Man and beat the crap out of him and got away. Then Spider Man went and found Venom to get help (you see Venom has this twisted thing about protecting innocents), and after some desperate reasoning Venom came along and together they took down Carnage. Carnage has escaped countless times after that and if you've ever played the game Maximum Carnage then you'd know that's just one of the times he's escaped. Well right now Carnage is locked up in Ravencroft Sanitarium and that's where my game begins.


== The Keys

Ok throughout the game you will get more attacks. You start with the tentacle attack. Press Z for that. Then later you get the Axe attack. Press X for that.

If at a time you are hurt too much and your symbiote is knocked off of you press A to call it back.


== Battle Systems

The primary battle system involves Carnage walking around killing bystanders with the attacks shown above and on some maps there are guards with sonic guns that try to blast your symbiote off.

The Secondary battle system is used for fights against bosses like Spider-Man, and Venom etc. In these battles your keys are A to block; Z for Attack1; X for Attack 2; and C for ATttack 3. The Battle sort of resembles a crappy Street Fighter clone but is still rather glitchy. I ripped most the graphics out of the roms Maximum Carnage and Seperation Anxiety. I'm not done fixing all of them up tho. Infact the only full character done in these battles is Spider-Man. Carnage and Venom's aren't finished. Also Spider-Carnage, and She-Venom make an appearance but I haven't started on their pics yet so I just used Spider-Man and Venom again.
