=======================

Welcome to the Galaxy Destroyer Demo Version.
As this is only an early demo release, there's no
real plot, only two characters, no puzzles, and in
short, nothing more than a few maps with (IMHO)
cool graphics.

Also, the VergeC's not as good as it could be.  In future
versions, I'll be using called subevents for chests and the
like, and other improvements.

Finally, this version is prone to crashing.  I have no idea
why.  It happens in the lava caves, after going down the ladder
from the pit.  The room has only one other exit, a door in the
north wall.  This *SHOULD* take you to where the kitten is, but
instead, it just causes a page fault error and crashes.  I have
no clue why this happens.  the only command in that particular
event is a Warp to the kitten room, no different than all the other
warps that I have in this demo, all of which work fine.  I've actually
tried changing the VC so that other doors go to the kitten room, and they
all crash.  It seems almost a fault of the destination coordinates, rather
than the script.  Wierd.  Vecna or Hahn or anyone else who knows VC, if you
have any ideas, let me know (dandjles@infinet.com)
