BATTLE
------
        As Bong wanders through his adventures, it's guaranteed that he will
run afoul of any number of nasty creatures and other irate customers.  So
Bong will need to fight back.  On the opening menu, select your action from
the eight available options.  Bong will act upon your command, and the
fighting ensues from there.  As he defeats more and more foes, Bong will
become better and better at triumphing over his foes.  Since Bong is a
completely hopeless combatant, you may be well advised to take U up on his
offer to time in the training room.
        As more and more battles are won, Bong will build up BLEARGH power.
Bleargh is the historical battle cry of the Bong family, and will grant
favors on Bong from time to time.  The more battles you win, the more often
Bleargh will bless you with its countenance.  You would be well advised to
try to appease Bleargh.
