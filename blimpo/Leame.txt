Hi ho Family!
How are you today my verge buddies.. Welcome to the 4th installment of BW. 
Why did I release this piece of crap?
I'm sorry for the Entity Enemies runnign around and spoiling your fun.. Sorry. 
I'm sure some people will love them and some people, like Feywood, will hate them.
Nah.. Feywood wont care since to him a game is only the plot.
Feywood: DONT PLAY BW! You will not like it!
vecna: Sorry for the bad use of your engine.
Silencer: Thank you for telling me how to use CurHP(CHR)-=2;
