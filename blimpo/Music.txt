Most of the music found on this game was stealed by me!
To look grateful I decided to print who wrote what.
If you dont want your music in my game, dont tell me because I dont care and
only like 4 people will actually play it anyway.  Dont be a dork. For more 
info on the songs, check out the samples using a mod played or something.
