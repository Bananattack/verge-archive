winverge (v1) v.0.90 beta
=========================

===========================================

Q: What is winverge?
A: winverge is a direct port of the last vecna-canon version of VERGE (V1)
   engine to windows/directx native. The port also entailed a port to C++,
   although it mostly is C++ by extension, and doesn't really use much C++,
   ie, I didn't rewrite everything to use classes or anything. I did not port
   VCC or MAPED to windows, so if you run Windows 2000 you still cannot
   actively develop a game in V1, but you can at least play the old demos
   and whatnot. Additionally, even for those with Win95/98, winverge is more
   stable than DOS V1, in addition to supporting any DirectInput and
   DirectSound device.

===========================================

Q: Will MAPED be ported?
A: Idunno. If there's enough call for it I guess. MAPED 2.0 works in Win2k,
   but you can't use it to develop V1 maps. There doesn't seem to be a huge
   audience of people developing V1 games and using Windows 2000.

===========================================

Q: Does it work with all V1 games?
A: No. It only supports a specific version of V1, which is fortunately
   what MOST of the V1 demos out there want, but not all. Some use customly
   modified EXEs (like Revelation or TCW), others use, for example,
   Wyrdwad's V1+ which is not supported, and I also do not support most of the
   additions in the post-vecna "dev-team" versions of verge, because frankly
   some of the stuff is either poorly designed or not stable. However when the
   source code is released, if someone would like to re-add the dev-team
   versions of V1 custom VCC commands, they're welcome to do so.

   As a minor aside, some games did not include a TRANS.TBL file. They're
   supposed to, and winverge will error out with an appropiate message if
   they don't. DOS V1 did not do this, and it was a source of instability
   and memory corruption. So, if you get this message, just copy a TRANS.TBL
   file from another V1 game (such as the Sully Chronicles pack-in) into
   that game's directory.

===========================================

Q: Are there any known bugs?
A: Most of the bugs from 0.80 beta have been fixed, ie, sound system bugs, random crashing,
   and a total lack of keyboard input. The biggest remaining 'issue' that might be perceived
   as a bug would be that a number of DirectDraw drivers do not support 320x200x8bit. This is 
   gay, and there is nothing we can do about this. Probably in a future version we will include
   windowed mode support, so you can run it regardless of your DirectDraw driver.

   Please report any bugs you find to vecna@verge-rpg.com.

Q: Whats the deal with winv2?
A: Um. Look! A three-assed monkey!
   (translation: I'm not doing it. zeromus is)

===========================================

Q: Hey, the framerate is extremely jumpy and I have a fast computer.
   What gives?
A: There's a good chance that you've done whats happened to myself and
   [air] a few times. If you have a joystick, gamepad, whatnot installed
   with DirectInput (ie, it appears in your Control Panel->Game Controllers
   dialog), but it's NOT PLUGGED IN, then winverge will try to poll the
   joystick, and the DirectInput joystick routine will take quite a big chunk
   of time waiting for a response from the joystick before it gives up and
   times out. The result is a super-crappy framerate on the fastest of
   computers. This may sound weird, but there've been times where my
   gamepad came unplugged accidentally, and such a thing will cause this.
   You can either plug the joystick back in, or if you're not going to use
   it, you might as well "Remove" it from the Game Controllers setup
   in Control Panel.

===========================================

Q: Whee, there's source code this time.
A: Yes. I've released it as free software. That is, REAL free software.
   Real free software, is of course, public domain. Not this GPL crap that 
   claims to be free (as in beer) and free (as in speech) blah blah. The
   RMS/GPL dogma, along with the slashdot rhetoric and drone mentality is
   sickening -- they claim their software is "free" as in freedom. Yet I,
   as a free software and open source author, cannot according to the GPL,
   use GPL code with my code, yet GPL programs CAN use my code. Now I ask
   you, which license is truly free? I had considered altering the license
   just so that it could not be used with GPL programs, or maybe a
   "Propietary-world license" that forbade porting to any open-source OS,
   but then I remembered that would make me as pathetic as them. I ain't
   like that, baby. ;)

   In any event, the code is free to do with as you choose. As [air] would
   say, "Giving me credit where credit is due is optional depending on your
   own levels of integrity and honesty." The only stipulation is that whatever
   you do with the code, you do at your own risk. There is no warranty, period.
