Changelog from 10/4/97 to 10/13/97
 - Woohoo! New internal animation system allows animation at nearly zero cpu
   cost! You can have gigantic strands, and a whole lot of them, all triggered
   at the same time, and it won't slow down the game even on a low-end 486.
   Not only is the new system faster, but you can have many different
   animation patterns! There's normal forward looping (mode 0),
   backward looping (mode 1),
   bi-directional looping (mode 3), and random mode (mode 2).
 - Anytime you start a new game or load a game, all advanced rendering
   properties are cleared (such as earthquake, screengradient, VC layer, etc)
 - OPTIMIZATIONS up the wa-hoo. Use the 'vspspeed' switch in your setup.cfg
   file to majorly speed up the foreground layer (it uses twice as much
   VSP memory however) The transparency routines have been rewritten in
   Assembly and are MUCH faster. The fullscreen MapPaletteGradient mode is
   much less of a speed hit; the night and flashback scenes of the packin
   demo run smoothly even on my 486/66.
