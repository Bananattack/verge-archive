Amazing isn't it? Due to popular demand, as well as a sudden burst of inspiration, Mannux has been recontinued! I've always loved this project, and I assure you that this will be finished. (Yeah, we've all heard that before ;) The engine has changed a bit since the last version, and the story, art, and music are all gonna be redone. 

If you're unfamiliar with Mannux however, it is a sidescroller similar to Super Metroid in gameplay. The story is explained in the intro, and the controls are right here (soon to be customizable :)

Left/Right - Move left or right.
Down - Duck (don't worry that you turn invisible, just a missing frame ;)
Up - Stop ducking.
Alt - Jump.
Ctrl - Run.
Space - Fire.

I'm sure you want to know what's new, which brings us to...

==========================================================================

* Things Added/Changed since last release *

- Ported it to V2.5, and cleaned much of the code. (The game runs faster now, but because of the framerate cap you probably won't notice)
- Added pixel accurate obstructions! (Actually this was added a long time ago, but not released because it was still buggy - it works [almost] perfectly now ;)
- Added working slopes (thanks Zaratustra!) and more efficient obstruction checking. 
- Worms now move around using a true AI, following slopes. :)
- Added collision detection for enemies-bullets and enemies-player. (you can now kill those pesky worms, but they can also kill you too. ;)

==========================================================================

* Known Bugs *

I'd like to think my code is perfect but that's hardly the case. Oh well, it's still beta. ;)

- Walking up and down slopes isn't perfect - you may notice a jump/fall in certain spots, but I think I ironed out most of the glitches.
- The pixel accurate obstruction code is more efficient but less accurate - it only checkes the corners of the chr. I intend to make it check more spots, once the new chr is done (which will likely have new dimensions, introducing more bugs for me to fix. Whee.)
- Not a bug, just a missing frame - pressing down to duck works but makes you invisible.
- The worm AI is easy to screw up (Try opening the door and have him walk up it), just a matter of adding more ifs. :)
- The doors are still a bit buggy.

==========================================================================

* Todo List *

This part of the file is pretty much for my own benefit, but feel free to read it and mail me suggestions if you'd like. ;)

Important Stuff:

- Add to the todo list. :P
- More enemies!
- Fix AI on the worms.
- New tiles and Tabby chr! 
  * extra frames required for tabby chr: Ducking, Hit frames, shooting up (and maybe on diagonals).
- Code for shooting up.
- Options screen:
  * Customize controls.
  * Save screen - necessary?
  * What else...?
- Ingame inventory/status screens.
- More gameplay elements - powerups, items, etc. (need to rework the story first)

Would be nice to have:

- fix "center" obstructions.
- new map scrolling for the "large" map format.
  * each general area will have its own map, rather than each room. This allows for smooth scrolling between each area.
  * when moving between areas, the screen will fade out like it is currently.
- Code for shooting on diagonals.
- Fix up the doors, they're still a tad buggy...

==========================================================================

* Credits *

H@tchet - Most of the code found in the game ;)
Jyrus - Tile and sprite artwork.
ArcticFox - The game's music.
Toen - Fixing up the story a bit.

Special thanks to:

aen: For making V2.5 and for coding a kick ass intro!
Zaratustra: For solving my slopes problem. 

And of course, thanks to everyone who actually downloaded this game, you're the reason why I'm still coding this thing today. :)
